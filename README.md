## About
This project leverages data analysis and natural language processing techniques to examine job postings for Data Analyst roles in the United States. The goal of the project is to identify key patterns and insights that could provide actionable intelligence for job seekers in the data science field. 

The analysis is centered around two key aspects:

1. **Hard Skills Analysis**: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the project aims to identify the most sought-after technical skills such as SQL, Python, Tableau, etc. in data analyst job descriptions.

2. **Soft Skills Analysis**: The project also intends to identify the most demanded soft skills by analyzing word frequencies in job descriptions. 

The project is divided into two Jupyter notebooks:

1. `Data Science Job Analysis.ipynb`: Performs exploratory data analysis and visualizations on the dataset.
2. `Dataset Reduction.ipynb`: Handles data cleaning, preprocessing and dimensionality reduction.

### Information About The Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search), which contains Google search engine results for Data Analyst job postings in the United States. Data collection started on November 4th, 2022, and adds ~100 new job postings daily.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, the following packages need to be installed. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud
```
## Results
The project is still ongoing and results will be updated as progress is made.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies using pip.
Run the notebooks in the order specified above. Note: Make sure to update the file paths in the notebooks if necessary.

## Future Steps
In the future, we plan to extend this analysis to compare the job requirements of Data Analyst positions with other roles in the data science field, such as Data Scientists and Data Engineers. Although these roles represent a minority in the current dataset, they could potentially provide additional insights into the differences in skill requirements across the data science field.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a data-driven guide for individuals planning to apply for jobs in the data science field. It aims to highlight the skills they should prioritize to increase their chances of landing their desired job.
